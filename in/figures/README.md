# Figures Directory

These figures are referenced in the text. Ideally, rather than tracking the content of these figures in this repository, you can create symlinks to the actual files located elsewhere,
or more elegantly, you can use Git Annex to track these symlinks for you while stowing the file contents safely within the .git/annex directory.

Git Annex is a powerful tool for synchronizing file contents between repos and because of this, it enables you to track the *provenance* of your figures. Need to go back and update a figure? Not sure what data a figure comes from? Git Annex can help with this. See [Provenance Tracking Recipe](../../docs/Provenance-Tracking-Recipe.md) for how to set this up.
